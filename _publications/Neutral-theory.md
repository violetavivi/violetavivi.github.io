# Abstract
Online social networks have significantly changed global communication dynamics. Despite the complexity of
such dynamics, emergent patterns from empirical microblogging data on hashtag usage, such as meme popularity
power-law distributions, have been observed. However, going beyond empirical or simulation-based studies,
highlighting and distinguishing fundamental mechanisms at the origin of such patterns are still open problems.
Herein, inspired by the neutral theory of ecology, we provide an analytical formalism capable of capturing
the competition for attention in online social systems and explaining several emergent patterns observed in the
context of information ecosystems. Specifically, besides meme popularity distributions, we study the persistence
distributions of memes within the network and the capacity of the system to sustain several coexisting diverse
memes. Such properties have a clear analogy to extinction time and biodiversity in natural ecosystems. In
the social network context, diversity of ideas is indeed an identifying characteristic of the “health” of the
communication process. We show how our theoretical framework is successful in explaining real data collected
from the Twitter online social network. The proposed framework introduced here provides both insight into the
roles played by competition and network structure on meme diversity and persistence, and an applicable null
model to be tested against real data.
