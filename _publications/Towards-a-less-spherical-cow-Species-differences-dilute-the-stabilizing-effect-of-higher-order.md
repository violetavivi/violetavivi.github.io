# Abstract
Ecological models traditionally explain stability and coexistence through pairwise interactions among species. These interactions can also involve groups of three or more species, higher-order interactions, which recent theory suggests can by themselves stabilize communities. However, ecological communities exhibit both pairwise and higher-order interactions, and how their interplay governs stability and coexistence remains unknown. This work addresses this gap by analyzing a model of competitive communities that incorporates a proportion of pairwise and higher-order interactions. Using empirical data, numerical simulations, and analytical methods, we show that higher-order interactions alone cannot guarantee coexistence. We find that, while a small fraction of higher-order interactions can stabilize dynamics in communities of identical species, this effect disappears under more realistic conditions -such as heterogeneity in birth and death rates, empirically derived rates, or explicit interaction structures. Our results challenge the prevailing view of higher-order interactions as a universal stabilizing mechanism, providing quantitative evidence of the joint importance of both pairwise and higher-order interactions, together with network structure and species parameters, for understanding ecological stability.
