:wave: I am a PhD student at [IFISC](https://ifisc.uib-csic.es/en/) (Institute for Cross-Disciplinary Physics and Complex Systems).

My research has focused, so far, on ecology and social systems within an ecological framework. The main objective of my thesis is to study how interactions influence the diversity and stability of ecological systems. To do so, I have used a range of different tools from agent-based models to nonlinear ODEs and, primarily, Network Science. 

You can find a surely outdated CV [here](http://violetavivi.github.io/files/myCV230522.pdf)

### Interests
- I have worked in: Ecological Interactions, Complex Networks, Theoretical Ecology, Computational Social Science, HOI
- I would love to worked in: Paleoecology, Evolutionary Dynamics, Dataviz, Game Theory,...

### Education
:hatched_chick: PhD in Complex Systems, _IFISC_  (expected)
      
:hatching_chick: Master in Physics and Physical Technologies, _University of Zaragoza_
      
:egg: Bachelor in Physics, _University of Zaragoza_
