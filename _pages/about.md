:wave: Postdoctoral fellow at Do√±ana Biological Station (CSIC), Spain, studying the variation of ecological interactions. Formerly at the Institute for Cross-Disciplinary Physics and Complex Systems, IFISC. 
<p style="text-align: justify"> 
My research has focused, so far, on ecological and social systems within an ecological framework. I humbly address one of the central questions in ecology: understanding how ecological interactions shape species' coexistence and long-term persistence. To explore this, I integrate data from field observations and experiments with theoretical frameworks and computational modeling, from agent-based models to nonlinear ODEs and, primarily, Network Science. 

  - Currently working on: Ecological interactions, Invasion graphs, Temporal networks, Coexistence, Structural Stability
