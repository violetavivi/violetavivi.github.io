This page collects references, links, data repositories, and books that I have found helpful or motivating. In all cases, the lists are highly biased by my own experience.


## Giving talks
- Jelena Grujic gave a good talk on [How to give a good talk][vTalk] at the [yrCSS] Warm-Up 2020. 
- Some basics in data visualization are always welcomed when designing your presentation. Data vis artists [Lisa Charlotte Muth][Lisa] and [Jane Adams][Jane] can help you with this.
- More tips on giving [scientific talks](https://drive.google.com/file/d/13efH6iA6toPtJ91KBt_QCeAyQBcSN7SA/view) and [data vis](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1LouVvISCRlWkItZgzoHcgoU5Q1VyHT4U/view) by researcher [Dan Larremore](https://larremorelab.github.io/dan/).
  
## Writing
- The book [How to Write a Scientific Paper: An Academic Self-help Guide for PhD Students](https://www.amazon.com/How-Write-Scientific-Paper-Self-Help/dp/173078416X) by the researcher [Jari Saramäki](https://jarisaramaki.fi/) is a gem. He was kindly enough to gave us a [talk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=czpwDkCTDjQ&list=PL2NiuOynAtBscCNd59bH4jS8SxAY_Uk5P&ab_channel=YoungResearchersoftheComplexSystemsSociety) about it and share its [slides](https://users.aalto.fi/~jsaramak/HowToWriteSciPaper_Palma.pdf) during the [yrCSS] Warm-Up 2022.
- On his [website](https://www.math.ucla.edu/~mason/), Manson A. Porter has a collection of writing resources, including examples of cover letters.
- The book [The elements of style](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Elements_of_Style) is not focused on academic writing, but it may be useful for non-native English speakers like me.
- Despite that title, [Writing Science: How to Write Papers That Get Cited and Proposals That Get Funded](https://www.amazon.com/Writing-Science-Papers-Proposals-Funded/dp/0199760241) has a lot of solid advice and knowledge about academic writing with very pertinent examples.
- [Daphne Gray-Grant](https://www.publicationcoach.com/blog/) is a publication coach that runs a writing blog with interesting tips about academic writing, from dealing with [writer's block]( https://www.publicationcoach.com/how-to-get-unstuck-when-writing/) to [mindmapping](https://www.publicationcoach.com/all-about-mindmapping/). Her newsletter helped me while writing my dissertation.
- I wrote about my PhD thesis [template](https://violetavivi.github.io/posts/2023/07/thesis/) and some personalization/formating tips.

## Mental health
- I remember that my supervisor [Sandro Meloni](https://ifisc.uib-csic.es/users/sandro/) sent me this list of [Twenty things I wish I’d known when I started my PhD](https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-018-07332-x) on my first day.
- [How to draw a cat](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=44H76Bbvung&ab_channel=struthless). Really, you need to draw a cat.
- I talked about [Dealing with the 3Ps: Procrastination, Productivity and PhD](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E1r2EOGwuSU&t=2s&ab_channel=NetPLACE) at a NetPLACE seminar.
- [A PhD Is Not Enough: A Guide To Survival In Science](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/587478.A_PhD_Is_Not_Enough). It is a bit outdated after  20 years but still. Actually, I do not endorse every single line but, it created an interesting internal debate when I read it just before starting to write my dissertation. It's helpful to know what others expect from you.
- Walk in nature and have a hobby :seedling:. I practice calisthenics and fold origami, what about you?
  
## Organizations for early-career researchers
- The young researchers of the Complex Systems Society ([yrCSS](http://yrcss.cssociety.org/yrcss-about/)) is an elected group of early-career researchers that promote and organize initiatives like annual Bridge Grants, Scholarships for Events on Complex Systems, and the Warm-Up School on Complex Systems with the support of the Complex Systems Society.
- [NetPLACE](https://sites.google.com/view/netplace/home-page) (Networks, Phd Life And ComplExity Seminars, or simply NetPLACE Seminars) are a group of early-career researchers that provide a friendly and cosy place for graduate and postgraduate students from all over the world to interact, to present new/interesting developments from their areas of interest in the complex systems and networks field, as well as their difficulties during the PhD study. Check their [Youtube channel](https://www.youtube.com/@netplace3823) for past talks!
- The "Young Modellers in Ecology" ([YoMos](https://www.yomos.org/)) are a group of young scientists working in all fields of ecological modelling. They organize annual workshops and conference meetings.
- The Society of Women in Network Science ([WiNS](https://sites.google.com/view/womeninnetworkscience/)) connects women, trans and non-binary gender network scientists from different races, socioeconomic backgrounds, and nations. The society aims to recognize the work, perspectives, and expertise of its members to create bridges between academia, government, and private industry related to network science.
