In this post, you can find my dissertation *Exploring ecological and social interactions through the lens of complex systems* and the LaTex files needed for generating the [pdf](https://ifisc.uib-csic.es/media/publications/publication/dfJWHsdBSGu9zp7MBz2WKQ.pdf){: .btn--research}.

{% include gallery id="gallery1" caption="The cover has been drawn using [Procreate](https://procreate.com/ipad). Pro tip: export your drawing to pdf and *then* add the text with a pdf editor to prevent blurred letters." %}

###Layout:

The layout is based on the [Harvard-thesis template](https://github.com/suchow/Dissertate). You can also download my own version:

The file to be compiled for my dissertation is `thesis.tex`.
